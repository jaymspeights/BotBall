        <h3>Create a New Game</h3>
        <p>Starting up a new game is as simple as issuing a '/create' request</p>
        <p class="code">https://jaymspeights.com/BotBall/create</p>
        <p>The response will be in JSON format and will contain the ID of the game created.</p>
        <pre class="code">
  {
    "game_id":{GAME_ID},
    "error":null
  }</pre>
        <p>We have now created a game and recieved it's ID, but we haven't yet joined it.</p>
        <h3>Join a Game</h3>
        <p>We can join a game by issuing a '/join' request</p>
        <p>In the request we need to encode the id of the game into the parameter 'game'</p>
        <p class="code">https://jaymspeights.com/BotBall/join?game={GAME_ID}</p>
        <p>Requesting join will activate an inactive player in the game, then
          if all players are active, the game will start.</p>
        <p>The response will be in JSON format and will contain the ID of the player.</p>
        <pre class="code">
  {
    "player_id":{PLAYER_ID},
    "error":null
  }</pre>
        <p>In the event that the game has no available players,
          instead 'error' will be non-null and 'player_id' will be null</p>
        <h3>Move a Player</h3>
        <p>To move a player, we need to issue a '/move' request.</p>
        <p>In this request, we will need to encode the game and player id's, and
          the direction we would like to move</p>
        <p class="code">https://jaymspeights.com/BotBall/move?game={GAME_ID}&player={PLAYER_ID}&dir={DIRECTION}</p>
        <p>If this is a valid move, it will be executed on the server and will show
          in the state of the game. Otherwise, 'error' in the response will contain the reason why the move couldn't be completed.</p>
        <h3>Access the State of a Game</h3>
        <p>To give your AI some access to important information such as the location of the ball
          and the location of the players, we need to make a '/state' request.</p>
        <p class="code">https://jaymspeights.com/BotBall/state?game={GAME_ID}&player={PLAYER_ID}</p>
        <pre class='code'>
{
  "field": {
    "width":11,
    "height":7,
    "goal_start":2,
    "goal_end":4
  },
  "players": [
    {"x":0,"y":3,"Color":"Green"},
    {"x":10,"y":3,"Color":"Blue"}
  ],
  "ball": {"x":5,"y":3},
  "game": {"over":false,"ttl": ,"start_time": ,"current_time:"},
  "you": 0,
  "error":null
}</pre>
        <p>'start_time' and 'ttl' will contain the Epoch time that the game starts and ends. 'current_time' will contain the current Epoch time.</p>
        <p>If the query parameter 'player' is not specified, the response will not contain 'you'.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Some example code in python. Uses the Requests module for the API calls.
          This script will start a new game, join it as both players,
          and then execute a sequence of moves to win</p>
        <pre class="code">
    import requests;
    import json;
    import time;

    uri = 'https://jaymspeights.com/BotBall/';

    # Adds another player to start the game
    requests.get(uri+'join?game='+gid);

    # Gets the state of the game to see time until it starts
    state = requests.get(uri+'state?game='+gid).json();
    start_time = float(state['game']['start_time'])/1000;
    current_time = time.time();

    # Sleeps until the game has started
    while True:
        state = requests.get(uri+'state?game='+gid).json();
        start_time = int(state['game']['start_time']);
        current_time = int(state['game']['current_time']);
        if start_time is None:
            time.sleep(3);
            continue;
        time.sleep((start_time - current_time)/1000);
        break;

        print(requests.get(uri+'move?game='+gid+'&player='+pid+'&dir='+dir).text);
